# Calculator-Parser
This project aims to create a simple calculator, that first parses and then calculates logical expressions.
The operators and symbols understood by the parser/calculator by order of priority are:
- "(" and ")", used to signify priority
- "&" for AND
- "^" for XOR
- Single digit integers

If non-allowed characters or other kinds of bad grammar, like not closing parentheses are detected, the calculator
throws "Parse Error" and terminates.

This project was created and tested with IntelliJ IDEA and OpenJDK18
